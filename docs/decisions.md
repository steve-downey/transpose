# Decision Log — grading in beman.transpose

Convention: each section answers one **question**, identified by a slug named
for the question, never the chosen answer (so the slug survives reversal:
`#empty-grade-spelling`, not `#bare-t`). All references anywhere in the repo
render as links to these anchors. Open questions live in the same namespace
with `Status: OPEN`; answering one graduates it in place — the slug and every
existing link stay valid. Divergences append dated entries to the implicated
question's Log; they do not get their own files.

Entry shape: Question / Status / Decision / Why / Log.

## empty-grade-spelling

**Question:** How is the ∅ (empty) grade spelled — bare `T` or
`expected<T, error_set<>>`?
**Status:** DECIDED 2026-08-28
**Decision:** Bare `T`. The uniform degenerate-expected form remains available
as an explicit spelling with the isomorphism documented once
(see [uniform-form-surface](#uniform-form-surface)).
**Why:** Bare `T` makes the unit fiber *identical* to the ungraded API, not
merely isomorphic — pure paths deduce character-for-character what they deduce
today, so grading has zero footprint until `error_set` is uttered. The
subsumption coercion out of ∅ is `expected`'s existing converting constructor
from `T`; the standard already implements η's coercion. Known deliberate
divergence from libfn, which spells the identity monad
`fn::expected<T, fn::copack<>>` (uniform family, unconstructible error
alternative) — a coherent choice for a closed pipeline library, the wrong
trade for an open boundary.
**Sentinel:** any framework path materializing `expected<T, error_set<>>`
without the user writing it violates this decision.
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Adopted in planning discussion (graded monads thread).

## grading-footprint

**Question:** What is grading permitted to change for existing clients at the
API level?
**Status:** DECIDED 2026-08-28
**Decision:** Grading claims only previously-ill-formed territory. For any
input combination that deduces a type today, the graded framework deduces the
same type. `error_set` appears in a deduced result only when an input already
carried one, or the combination was previously ill-formed (mixing
`expected<T,E1>` with `expected<T,E2>`, which now joins). Corollary — no
spontaneous singletons: unmixed `expected<T,E>` pipelines never become
`expected<T, error_set<E>>`; join is lazy, entering only at a genuine mixing
point. Graded and ungraded CPO overloads are mutually exclusive by constraint
(structural presence of `error_set`), never merely ranked.
**Why:** This is the entire additive-compatibility story, and it is available
only because of [empty-grade-spelling](#empty-grade-spelling). Accepted
residue: previously-ill-formed combinations becoming well-formed flips
detection idioms (`requires`, SFINAE) — additive and tolerated; changed
deductions on previously-valid code are not tolerated.
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Adopted; mechanized as the golden deduction tests in stage
  [baseline-capture](transpose-grading-plan.md#baseline-capture).

## error-set-identity

**Question:** Is `error_set` a nominal type or any suitably normalized
structural sum?
**Status:** DECIDED 2026-08-28
**Decision:** Nominal. `error_set<Es...>` is its own type: canonicalization
(sorted, deduplicated via type ordering) is a class invariant enforced at
construction; converting constructors encode exactly the `⊆` widenings and
nothing else; the data-facing API is deliberately impoverished (visitation and
membership for `recover`; not a variant competitor). May share storage/visit
machinery with a structural sum by composition or private inheritance; the
public identity never slices into the structural world.
**Why:** Type as semantics. A sum of types is representation; "the set of
errors this computation may raise" is an interpretation, and interpretations
need names. Nominality makes structural grade detection sound (it conscripts
only the willing) and dissolves the datum-vs-grade ambiguity at the
declaration site: `expected<T, variant<A,B>>` is a value-level sum error,
`expected<T, error_set<A,B>>` is the graded carrier. Having *only* the subset
conversions is the coherence argument compiled into the overload set (sorted
normalization = names-not-positions; inclusions unique). Precedents:
`chrono::duration`, `std::byte` — semantics carried by what the type refuses.
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Adopted.

## grade-machinery-home

**Question:** Where does grade machinery live — typeclass surface, or
framework/grade-algebra infrastructure?
**Status:** DECIDED 2026-08-28
**Decision:** Never on the typeclass surface. `grade_of<Ctx>` and
`rebind_grade<Ctx,G>` are framework traits with structural defaults
(pattern-match the `error_set` shape; everything else is ∅-graded;
customizable for exotic carriers). `join`/`bottom`/`subsume` are operations of
the grade algebra (`grade_semilattice` concept), written once, with
`error_set` as the shipped model. The CRTP base absorbs promotion of bare
values at ∅, ap-from-bind, and defaulted subsume as constrained members that
SFINAE away silently.
**Why:** Gadget-author ergonomics: registering a kind must stay "a couple of
functions," and duck typing at use sites is a feature to preserve. Invariant:
an instance that knows nothing about grades works verbatim, treated as
uniformly ∅-graded; the monad instance remains *identical to* the applicative
instance because grades ride in deduced return types — there is no separate
graded spelling to diverge into.
**Sentinel:** a typeclass instance that must declare grade participation, or
contains a bare/graded mixed-case overload, means the factoring has leaked.
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Adopted.

## applicative-objects

**Question:** How do the two applicative structures over one carrier
(short-circuit, accumulating) relate, and which owns bind?
**Status:** DECIDED 2026-08-28
**Decision:** Two distinct NTTP-pinned typeclass objects over the same carrier
and grade algebra. Bind belongs to the short-circuit (monad-derived) object
only; the framework never auto-derives bind for the accumulating object.
Traverse takes an explicit, defaulted applicative-object policy
(see [traverse-policy-surface](#traverse-policy-surface)). Traversal order is
specified normatively: left-to-right.
**Why:** Accumulation has no graded bind — when the first computation failed
there is no value to feed the continuation, so the promised joined grade
cannot be honored; a value-flow obstruction no grade bookkeeping fixes.
Normative order is required because grades are order-blind (∪ commutes) while
short-circuit *values* are order-sensitive (which error is observed first
depends on child order) — the types cannot pin what the wording must.
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Adopted.

## recover-grade-inference

**Question:** Are grades narrowed by `recover` inferred or annotated at fold
boundaries?
**Status:** DECIDED 2026-08-28
**Decision:** Annotated and checked. `recover` handling {H} takes grade e to
(e ∖ H) ∪ raised; inside recursive folds, inference of the resulting grade is
a least-fixed-point computation on the lattice. The user annotates the
intended grade; the framework verifies. Inference only where no fixpoint is
required.
**Why:** The fixpoint is finite (bounded lattice) but runs as template
recursion — compile-time cost and specification complexity for a rare
construct. Annotate-and-check keeps grade computation a fold of joins.
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Adopted.

## grade-generality

**Question:** How general is the grade algebra — is `error_set` the grade, or
one model of a grade concept?
**Status:** DECIDED 2026-08-28
**Decision:** One model of a concept. The framework layer speaks only grade
vocabulary (`grade_of`, `join`, `subsume`, `bottom`); error vocabulary
(`error_set`, `recover`, ⊆-as-may-raise) is confined to the model layer. A
future algebra is adopted by supplying a `grade_semilattice` model with
decidable type-level canonical forms. Deliberately excluded: non-idempotent
grade monoids (cost, fuel) — fold grades would become runtime-shape-dependent,
forcing indexed data types; fuel is a perpendicular NTTP axis prototyped in
compile-time-scheme, entering (if ever) as a componentwise product of grades,
never through the error door.
**Why:** The three semilattice properties are load-bearing everywhere:
commutative ⇒ order-free grade arithmetic; idempotent ⇒ shape-independent
fold grades (Fix stays ungraded); order-from-join ⇒ canonical, coherent
subsumption. The concept-with-one-shipped-model posture is kept honest by a
second test-only model (see [optional-grade-model](#optional-grade-model) and
stage [law-harness](transpose-grading-plan.md#law-harness)): an abstraction
with one model is renamed, not generic.
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Adopted.

## uniform-form-surface

**Question:** What is the surface for the explicit uniform spelling (the
documented iso from [empty-grade-spelling](#empty-grade-spelling)) —
constructor, named function, or both?
**Status:** OPEN
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Raised during planning.

---

## datum-entry-point

**Question:** Is an `as_computation`-style explicit entry needed for the rare
"error_set as a datum" author, or does the
[error-set-identity](#error-set-identity) fence make it YAGNI until a
divergence proves otherwise?
**Status:** OPEN
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Raised during planning; default posture is YAGNI.

## traverse-policy-surface

**Question:** How is the traverse applicative-object policy spelled at call
sites — NTTP object parameter or tag type?
**Status:** OPEN
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Raised during planning.

---

## optional-grade-model

**Question:** Where does the Boolean semilattice model ({⊥,⊤}, the "may-fail
bit") live long-term — test-only leak detector, or shipped as `optional`'s
official grade registration?
**Status:** OPEN
**Log:**
- 2026-08-28 — Raised during planning. Note: shipping it quietly unifies
  optional and expected under one framework and likely belongs in the paper's
  rationale either way.
