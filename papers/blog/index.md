One operation &#x2014; <code>transpose</code> &#x2014; turns out to hide a whole customization mechanism behind it.
The series starts from a loop everyone has written, names the two typeclasses underneath, shows what it costs a type to opt in and an algorithm to consume it, and ends among the prior art that kept reinventing the same idea.
Read it in order, or jump to the part you need.
