## traverse [transpose.alg.traverse]{- .sref} {-}

```cpp
template<class F, class T,
         class POLICY =
             remove_cvref_t<decltype(applicative_typeclass<traverse_context_t<F, T>>)>>
  requires applicative_object_for<POLICY, traverse_context_t<F, T>>
auto traverse(F&& function, T&& value, POLICY policy = POLICY{});
```

[x]{.pnum} *Constraints*: `POLICY` satisfies `applicative_object_for` for the context that applying `function` to an element of `value` yields.

[x+1]{.pnum} *Effects*: Applies `function` to each element of `value` and composes the resulting contextual values with `policy`, preserving the shape of `value`. Elements are visited in the structure's iteration order, and the contextual values are composed in that same order.

[x+2]{.pnum} *Returns*: The shape of `value` held in the single context `policy` composes into.

[x+3]{.pnum} *Complexity*: Exactly one application of `function` per element of `value`.

[x+4]{.pnum} *Remarks*: Let CONTEXT be the type that applying `function` to an element of `value` yields. `POLICY` defaults to the type of the applicative object `applicative_typeclass<CONTEXT>` names, which stops at the first failing element, and the constraint is `applicative_object_for<POLICY, CONTEXT>`. Passing the object `accumulating_applicative_typeclass<CONTEXT>` names instead composes every element's evidence. No element's context depends on another element's value, so this is independent contextual composition rather than sequential dependence.
